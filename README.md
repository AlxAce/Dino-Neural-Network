# Dino Neural Network


### Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by ssusnic's implementation of [Flappy Birds](https://github.com/ssusnic/Machine-Learning-Flappy-Bird)
- This project uses code from [Chromium](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/tree/master/components/neterror/resources) and [Synaptic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic/blob/master/dist/synaptic.min.js)

### TODO
- [X] record fitness of each dino
- [X] figure out why dinos start further back after restarting
- [X] display individual dino scores
- [X] destroy all dinos if they all fall below threshold

### ideas for improvement
- [ ] implement crossover??
- [ ] weight likelihood of selecting a dino based on its fitness
- [ ] use type of obstacle as an input to NN
- [ ] experiment with different NN structures
- [ ] try using one output node vs 2
