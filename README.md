# Dino Neural Network


### Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by ssusnic's implementation of [Flappy Birds](https://github.com/ssusnic/Machine-Learning-Flappy-Bird)
- This project uses code from [Chromium](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/tree/master/components/neterror/resources) and [Synaptic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic/blob/master/dist/synaptic.min.js)

### TODO
- [X] let user train dinos until a certain score is reached
- [X] turn off invert when not rendering
- [ ] don't change (and mess up) game when window is resized
- [X] make deltaTime constant to prevent lag?
- [ ] stop training after reaching score (don't wait for dinos to crash)
- [ ] give scoreboard more digits
- [ ] find some way to export successfully models

### ideas for improvement
- [ ] implement crossover??
- [ ] experiment with different NN structures
- [ ] add complement of child
